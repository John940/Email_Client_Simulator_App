##  Email client Simulator Project

This simulates an email client application , that it can **read** emails and **delete** them.

We use Tkinter for GUI and we read the email from the emails.txt file

To work correctly, emails must have this **format**:

***from:User Subject:Title1 date:22/12/12 +/n***

***Email text…..Email text …..Email text…*** 

To _Read_  an Email press _Enter Button_ at selected Email.

To  _delete_  an Email press _D button_  at selected email.

**Note:** Email deleted permanently
