##  Email client Simulator Project

This simulates an email client application , that it can **read** emails and **delete** them.

We use Tkinter for GUI and we read the email from the emails.txt file

To work correctly, emails must have this **format**:

*** from:User Subject:Title1 date:22/12/12 ..

Email text…..Email text …..Email text… ***

To * * Read * *  an Email press * * Enter * *  Button at selected Email.
To * * delete * *  an Email press * D button * *  at selected email.
** Note: ** Email deleted permanently
